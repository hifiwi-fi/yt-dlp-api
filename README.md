# yt-dlp-api

Running yt-dlp as a long running flask server.

## Notes

Not using python much these days so here are some reminders:

- Create a virtual env like this

```console
python3 -m venv venv
```

- Activate virtual env

```console
source venve/bin/activate
```

- Install dependencies with pip

```console
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Update requirements.txt

```console
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
